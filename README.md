# Anime-Filler

Using .py file as of now.

You must enter in a .txt file that contains numbers, look at cannonList.txt for format example

Current functionality: The script currently goes through the text file, deletes whitespace (" " and "\n"), deletes commas, add between dashes (2-7 would be 2,3,4,5,6,7), then asks user for the episode that they are on in the list then will return the number of episodes left

Future features in program: Create functions to process filler material and return when next filler episode will occur
